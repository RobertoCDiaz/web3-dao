# Web3 DAO

A Decentralized Autonomous Organization composed of owners of an item from a specific NFT collection.

In a DAO, all members are able to create and vote on decisions that have a deadline. After the deadline, the decision is then made in favour of the voting outcome ("yes" or "no").

## DAO Requirements

* Anyone with a WNC NFT can create a proposal to purchase a different NFT from a NFT marketplace.

* Everyone with a WNC NFT can vote for/against the active proposals.

* Each NFT count as one vote.

* Voters cannot vote multiple times on the same proposal with the same NFT.

* If before a specified deadline, the majority of voters vote for a proposal, it will be "approved" and the NFT purchase will be automatically executed.
